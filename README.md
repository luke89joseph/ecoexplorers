# Ecoexplorers
## Level up your eco awareness ðŸŒ²

EcoExplorers is a game that allows users to play multiple arcade style mini games, each centered around different topics related to sustainable energy and environmental change. Mini games typically use the theme of common arcade games like Space Invaders and Flappy Bird but with their own special twist related to the topic they cover. Mini games also educate the user on information related to the topic which is quizzed at the end of the challenge. Those that complete both the quiz and challenge for the mini game earn one of the special badges they need to complete EcoExplorers.
